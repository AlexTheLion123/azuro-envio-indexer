async function don't pass loader

graphql vs envio:

load -> get (use context e.g. context.CoreContract.get(event.srcAddress);)
bind -> create web3 instance -> check getLPAndNameOfFreebetV1Details for example


Questions:
1. when do we not have to use loader function (or do we always use)
2. loading multiple entities? (actually saw an example of this in core, will try copy tomorrow)
2. why core_id instead of core (certain things have id proceeding them)
3. Any situation where createEvent is needed? 
4. Error checking? Return null?
5. load with id or address?
6. Should I return entity after setting properties?
7. How to check code is correct?
